Hi Jan,

How many hours are there in a day in Germany? :-) [*]

&gt;<i> It's just cleanup work of the build process and the libeml dependencies.

Thx for the patch!  IIRC Tom had some problems when using the posix
API, that's why he switched to the native skin.  But he can surely explain
that better than me. 
At the very least the &quot;using xeno-config&quot; part of your patch seems an improvement!

&gt;<i> Further suggestions: make libeml a dynamic library (and link that one
</I>&gt;<i> already against pthread_rt).
</I>
I haven't looked into it yet, but that should be a default option when
configuring a cmake build I think.

&gt;<i> Unless there is still some critical checkin pending, please feel free to
</I>&gt;<i> announce your work on rtnet-users and xenomai-help/core. I will put some
</I>&gt;<i> link on the RTnet homepage then.
</I>
I haven't had time to review Tom's code myself :-) + I want to verify we
haven't broken anything regarding the ecos port first + build some
extra security into the build system.

&gt;<i> Now I wish I had some hardware to try... :)
</I>
Answer to [*]: There must be at least 96 if you want to loose time on
real hardware :-)

Thx,

Klaas
