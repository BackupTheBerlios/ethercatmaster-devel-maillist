The port has mainly been done by a master student (in cc:) . The 0.1
version of the source code was portable so the xenomai port was not
that hard, however the build system used must be revamped completely
to get the ethercat stack out of the ecos tree.

I have currently succeeded to recompile the ethercat source tree,
using the cmake build system.   It is set up in a way that should also
make it possible to integrate the xenomai port fairly easy.  You can
find it in the subversion tree of eml
<https://developer.berlios.de/svn/?group_id=6087>.  However, this is
not yet well tested at all, and the ecos specific stuff is still in
the eCos tree (and will probably remain there!
Tom is studying for his exams now, and will start integrating his
sources into the berlios svn tree in february I guess.  I don't have
the sources here, so you'll have to ask him.

ps.  This reminds me of the fact that the news item should have
appeared on the devel mailinglist, but for some reason it did not come
through.  So for the record:
<https://developer.berlios.de/forum/forum.php?forum_id=23791>
ps2.  Please redirect follow up posts to ethercatmaster-users
Mailinglist only (so I don't have to put
allinterestedpeople at thewholeworld.com in cc :-)
