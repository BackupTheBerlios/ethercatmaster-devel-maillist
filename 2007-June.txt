Great news!

I see both advantages and disadvantages to both solutions

[1] PRO: would allow you to reduce the size of the resulting binary for
     deeply embedded masters by just including the necessary
     definitions (and e.g. keep the necessary xml-files in flash)

[2] PRO: it would ofcourse be nice if EML comes with support for a lot
     of devices out of the box, especially for those (RT-)linux users
     having few constraints in terms of memory space.
     CON: Given the fact that there are quite some xml-files out there
     (see e.g.~a recent post of Roland about a different revision
     number for a specific module), it might prove hard to provide the
     user with object code that just works for (almost) every single
     device.

There might be other points to.

Do you already have an idea which "parser-helper" library to use?

FWIW, for the RTT part of orocos project, both the xerces-c library
and the tinyxml library (included in the orocos source code) were
used for parsing orocos "property files". 
See e.g. <http://osdir.com/ml/science.robotics.orocos.devel/2006-08/msg00248.html>
Both have pro's and cons (mainly size vs. functionality).

Considering the fact that EML also has an eCos port, and the xerces-c
parser requires support for exceptions not present in the standard
toolchains available for eCos (see
e.g.~<http://zylin.com/pipermail/zylin-discuss_zylin.com/2006-October/000317.html>)
my first choice would be the tinyXML parser. [*]

best regards,

Klaas

[*] Note that I finally succeeded using xerces-c for orocos-on-ecos,
     but it really is a pain in the ass.

No,not at the moment,  however, in term of facility I know it will be
fast for me to develop either first a python xml parser or an xslt that
generates C code to integrate. I have had a look at tinyxml it does not
seem more complicated to use.
