Subject: [Ethercatmaster-devel] Linux port
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0804071338260.25044@ampere.labo01.fmtc.be>

Hi,

In r32, I just committed a plain gnu/linux "port" of EML.  Well,
"port" is maybe a big word, since the code only slightly differs from
the RTnet/xenomai port.
This port was kindly contributed by Rene van der Molengraft.  They are
using (and have tested, I presume :-) it on top of a PREEMPT_RT kernel.

Some remarks:
- Me/myself and I only revamped and compile tested Rene's code.
- Ideally, I think we should end up with a single "posix" port with
   some ifdef-ed NP extensions.  However, this is not an ideal word.
   Feel free to improve it :-)
- I've added a comment in the rtnet port, since I think the "posix"
   header prefix shouldn't be necessary if the xenomai posix wrapper code
   is adequately defined in the top level CMakelists file.

ps.  Other contributions (e.g. I recall somebody telling me about a MS
      windows port he had done, which might be useful for
      testing/understanding the code) are still welcome.

Message-ID: <200804241225.47405.peter.soetens@fmtc.be>

Hi,

1 out of 100.000 Ethernet packets is lost during transmission due to 
electromagnetic interference. This requires each driver implementation to 
anticipate upon packet loss and retry sending if a packet does not return.
The current 'Linux' (src/arch/posix/ethercat_posix_drv.c) implementation does 
not do this and waits forever after a while.

The patch below was tested and fixed the problem for vanilla Linux (PREEMPT, 
*not* PREEMPT_RT). We had to set the timeout to 2000us instead of 100us to 
get the desired timeout behaviour in recv(). Maybe a PREEMPT_RT kernel could 
do better.

Peter

PS: the master-test program crashes when no devices/cables are connected. due 
to line 64 using an unchecked pointer.
PPS: setting MAX_TRIES_TX to 10 is not robust for someone unplugging the cable 
and then plugging it back in... Why is there a limit ?

Fixed in r33.  Thanks!

Not only on that line...  However, I would first like to merge the
code of the different tests programs into one file, instead of fixing
this in each test program (see bugzilla note below).

Tom added this in r28, see 
<https://svn.berlios.de/wsvn/ethercatmaster/trunk/src/arch/RTnet/ethercat_xenomai_drv.c?op=diff&rev=28&sc=1>

I *think* the rationale to setting a limit is/was that, in case something
*really* fishy happens, this should be handled at a _higher_ level in
the stack, instead of just keep trying at the low level.

While looking at how this was implemented in the eCos port, I noticed
I didn't (take the time to) integrate the eCos code into the build
system too.  Looks like a bugzilla might be useful anyway?

regards,

Klaas

- Bugzilla installation seems to work (attachments not yet tested)
- Removed bug tracker from berlios pages.
- Added link to EML homepage

EML 0.1 already had nice RTOS wrapper code, but was using the eCos build
system.  The Xenomai/RTnet port also brought a switch to cmake, but the
arch/eCos code has not yet been imported in the SVN repository.

The ethercat standard allows several protocols on top of ethercat.  Taking into
account popular demand, it seems EML would benefit most from CanOpen over
EtherCAT.
