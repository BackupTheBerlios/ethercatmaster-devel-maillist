Subject: [Ethercatmaster-devel] [Announce] FMTC changes EML license to
	Lesser GPL
Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.1.10.0808081056480.23184@ampere.labo01.fmtc.be>

The Flanders' Mechatronics Technology Centre changes the EML license from GPL into the more industry-friendly Lesser-GPL. All code available through the Berlios SVN server is adapted from r40 on.

Klaas

ps.  Note that the additional part of the license still holds: the right to use EtherCAT Technology is granted and comes free of charge under condition of compatibility of product made by Licensee. People intending to distribute/sell products based on the library, have to sign an agreement to guarantee that products using software based on EML *stay compatible with the actual EtherCAT specification* (which are released themselves as an open standard) as the (only) precondition to have the right to use EtherCAT Technology, IP and trade marks.

Subject: [Ethercatmaster-devel] patch for review
Message-ID: <3BAF6399A0B7E644851E85779E60AC796195@dl145.triphase.local>

Hallo,
 
In attachment a patch solving following problems describe below. Can you
give some feedback ?

Frederik

Index: src/arch/RTnet/ethercat_xenomai_drv.c
=============================================
*) replace some for loops by a memcpy or memset command
*) fix for following problem :

	Did some quick look-ups:
	- In the Ethercat Spec (Ethercat Communication Specification
1.0, 2004) I used to implement EML back in the middle ages, there's no
mention of that 64 bytes.
	- However, in the EtherCAT spec I just downloaded from
ethercat.org (Ethercat specification V1.0, Part 3, DLL specification),
this *is* mentioned in section 4.3, DLL overview.

	Conclusions:
	- Ethercat.org seems to have difficulties maintaining a
one-to-one relationship between version numbers and specificitions :-((
	- EML is not in sync anymore with the latest spec, I'll submit a
bug for this.

	Thx for pointing this out!

	Klaas

Index: src/CMakeLists.txt
=========================
When you excecute 'make install', first the architecture-dependent
header files were installed, and then the architecture independent
header files. This had as consequence that some architecture-dependent
header files (e.g. netif.h and ethercat_datastruct.h for RTnet) were
overwritten by the architecture-independent header files although you
need the architecture-dependent header files.

The patch switches the install order to solve this problem : first
install the architecture-independent header files and then the
architecture-dependent header files.

Looks Fine.  Will apply  Tom's "tel" variable made me laugh though :-)

This only fixes the issue for xenoMai.  I guess the better place to fix this in in de EC_Frame::dump() method, where you could check whether the data_length is < 44 bytes, and add some if not.  This would make the fix available for all OS-es at once.

OK, thanks!
